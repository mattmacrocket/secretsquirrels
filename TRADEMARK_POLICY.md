# SquirrelOps Trademark Policy

This policy governs use of the SquirrelOps name, logos, and related project marks (the "Marks").

## Ownership

The Marks are owned by Matt MacDougall / Rocket Web. The project license (`PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0`) covers code and content usage rights, but it does not grant trademark rights.

## Uses Allowed Without Permission

You may do the following without separate trademark permission:

- Use the project name in factual, non-misleading references (for example: "built from SquirrelOps").
- Link to this repository and unmodified source releases.
- State truthful compatibility claims (for example: "compatible with SquirrelOps") that do not imply endorsement.

## Uses That Require Written Permission

You must obtain written permission before you:

- Use the Marks in a product, service, company, or package name.
- Use the Marks in domain names or social handles.
- Use the Marks in logos, branding, or marketing that could imply affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement.
- Offer commercial services that are branded as SquirrelOps.

## Forks and Modified Versions

If you distribute a modified version:

- Do not present it as the official SquirrelOps project.
- Remove or replace official logos/branding assets.
- Clearly label it as a fork (for example: "YourName SquirrelOps Fork").

## Questions and Permission Requests

Open an issue in this repository to request trademark permission or discuss commercial licensing.
